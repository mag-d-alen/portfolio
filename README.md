# portfolio
My portfolio is a single page application built with seantic html and styled with Sass.
It uses scss grid and flex as well as media queries to make the design fully responsive. 
It uses 8bit images and simple JS to enhance user animations (smooth scroling and dynamic overlay). 
The idea is to showcase my projects and provide with a description of each of them, a link to github reository and an image/animation. 
The first draft committed on Jan 06 2021
